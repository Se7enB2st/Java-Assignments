//San Jose State University Intro to Java Assignment: Flower

// Write a class that describes a flower. A flower has a location, a
// constructor and a draw method.
// The flower should look like the picture below:
// http://i.imgur.com/OC4EA29.png

// The constructor takes the (x, y) coordinate of the upper left-hand
// corner of the flower. The arrow points to the x,y coordinates of
// the flower.
 
// There are four pink petals and a yellow center. Each petal and the
// center is a circle with a diameter of 20. A circle is an ellipse in
// which the width and height are both equal to the diameter of the
// circle. The pink circles touch the yellow one.

// The stem is green and is on the center line of the flower. Its
// length is 3 times the diameter.
