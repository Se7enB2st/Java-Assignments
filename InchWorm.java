//San Jose State University Intro to Java Assignment: Inch Worm

// Write a class InchWorm that models an inch worm moving along a 
// horizontal line. The inch worm  moves either to the right or left.
// Initially, the inch worm moves to the right, but it can turn to
// change its direction. In each move, its position changes by one
// unit in the current direction. 

// Provide two constructors. 
// One that takes the initial position as an argument,
// and one with no arguments that sets the initial position to 0. 

// You will need two instance variables. 
// One to keep track of the position and one to keep track of the direction. 
// You can use 1 to represent moving right and -1 to represent moving left.
